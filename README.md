# ENSIChat 

ENSIChat is a chatbot designed to assist prospective students at the National School of Computer Science (ENSI) by providing real-time, personalized answers to frequently asked questions about courses, student clubs, campus life, and more. The project aims to enhance accessibility to accurate information, addressing the limitations of ENSI's static website and reducing reliance on informal sources like social media groups.
